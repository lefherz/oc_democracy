# occ market:install democracy

Imagine you could install citizen rights with one mouseclick.

## Background

Code is law - and the part of our life that happens in cyberspace, follows
certain rules and configurations. Should those rules be made by the sysadmin,
by the state, by the company, or by the users?

Platforms have emerged both as business models and as power structures. Their
power comes from their users, their monopoly from network effects. How can
users protect their autonomy in an environment where competition doesn't
work?

Few platforms govern the Internet - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and
Microsoft divide the world up between them. ownCloud wants to challenge their
power by replacing some of their proprietary services, but this is a long road,
and has some problems.

One of the problems: ownCloud is a platform, too. Right now, admins are
dictators on their server, after the principle of hardware ownership and
souvereignty.

In ownCloud, admins can make the most decisions. This makes sense in an
Enterprise context - most companies have strict hierarchies. In the community,
it transfers the power to the Nerds.

ownCloud is better than Facebook or Amazon - with them, you can only complain
or leave. In ownCloud, you can also host it yourself and federate.

As an ownCloud admin, this annoys me. I would love to give more power to the
users, but atm I can only listen to feedback - the tools are missing.

A democracy app for instance-internal decision making could give users the
possibilities to propose configuration changes, request extensions, and vote on
them.

As soon as https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/ is ready, I want to work on
such an app - join me!

## Concept

**Why?** In platform capitalism, users should have more power. Decentralization helps - but platform-internal democracy is even better.

**What?** Let users participate in their ownCloud.

**How?** Through an app, users can discuss and vote on topics.

### Feature Brainstorming

Ideas welcome!

Transparency:

* Who is admin, how to contact them
* Which apps are installed
* Disk usage - is my data limit fair?
* How is the server configured?
* How much does the setup cost monthly? Who pays for it?

Board:

* A (minimalistic) board with topics concerning the ownCloud - e.g. extension
  requests, configuration requests

Polls:

* Which apps should be installed?
* How big should data limits be?
* Do we want this or that configuration?
